# Installation

If you already have a well-configured development environment and are already accustomed to managing separate environments for your projects, just `pip install streamlit` from your project environment and head on over to [Basic concepts](). For more information about your various options and how to get started from scratch, read on! (There could also be an "Advanced quickstart" added to the mix for the well-informed developers who just want the commands without explanation.)

If you're looking to get started right away, jump to our [Cloud quickstart]() to create a Community Cloud account, fork a template, and jump right into a development environment using GitHub Codespaces. Othwerwise, read on to understand your options.

## Local development

Python environments vs dev containers

## Cloud developlment

Options like GitHub Codespaces, which are created using a dev container. (Future: stlite playground.) Community Cloud is a platform for hosting Streamlit apps, but includes convenient automation to configure GitHub Codespaces for you. Jump in with our [Cloud quickstart]() or learn more in [Community Cloud]().
